hai everyone

today i am going to talk about how technology impact on humans

now technology is the shadow for humans, you can find it everywhere in your day to day life,technology is just an idea went from a lazy persons mind to make their works easier, At olden days we have different sources for different things like if we want to listen music you can listen through radio or ipods and we wokeup with alarm clocks and we communicate with others through landlines, now when technology increases we will find a solution like mobiles rather than work with multiple devices, now everything  can fit into single device and made our life easy, we can communicate through the world with just mobile, now even you dont need to buy things to go to market or stores,we had a lot of ecommerce sites to buy from your home and they can deliver to your home,it gives lot of employment to people and stores can grow their business digitally we can purchase anything digitally even you dont have a rupee in your pocket,technology also helps for our  primary sector farming,now we had a lot of machinery items for growing and cutting crops,their is consequences with technology also like coin had two sides,its  effecting human nature,now we are facing dangerous virus,in this situation most of the institutions can teach their children through online,we will be happy for that how technology helpful to our children. everyone doesn't have resources to learn from online, so there is the class topper, they don't have money to buy a phone and to learn through online, she committed suicide a week back for the fear of losing her grades, for me technology is important but not for every time, recently I read a post how we are in technology if phones are tied with wires we had a lot of values now those are free with wires we are far from values.
